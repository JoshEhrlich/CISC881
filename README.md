# CISC881

In this repo, you will find two folders. In the "coding" folder there are is a folder titled "Models" and a file titled "BreastSegmentation". In the "Models" folder, there are three files each starting with "segmentation_unet". Each file contains the implementation of each of the model modifications. To run one of the models, modify its name to "segmentation_unet" by removing the last part of the file name. For MP_NF, multiple modifications occured within that file. Uncomment specific variables to see their effect.The other file in "coding" titled "BreastSegmentation" is the jupyter notebook that contains the whole implementation of the model, which calls the other segmentation_unet file. To run this file, you must get acces from Tamas Ungi to gain the data. This is clinical data and I am not the individual that can determine who is able to access the data.

In the SavedNotebooks folder, there is a list of all relevant implementations of my models. There are additional models that you may want, so please ask. But the ones listed are saved HTML jupyter files for you to see the outputs.
